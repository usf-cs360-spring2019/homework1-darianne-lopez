      <h3>Interpretation</h3>

      <p>
        This visualization shows the number of incidents recorded by each police district during December 2018. The stacked bar chart is to show if there is a significant difference in the number of incidenct recorded on each day of the week. As we can see here, there is no dramatic difference, however, in some police districts it's interesting to note how the weekends have a similar number of incidents as the rest of the days of the week.
      </p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        The primary goal of this visualization was to make a connection between the days of the week, number of incidents and the police districts during December 2018. One challenge when viewing this chart is we can see from the y-axis that the number of incident reports get past 2000, and there is a wide gap between each tick mark. Since we have 7 different categories (days) we are coloring the data by, it is hard to see exectly how different the number of incidents fluctuates with each day of the week.

      <h3>Interpretation</h3>

      <p>
        This visualization is as it seems, the number of incident reports for the 10 ten districts with the most incident reports for December 2018.
      </p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        The primary goal of this chart was to show where majority of these incidents from December 2018 took place.

      <h3>Interpretation</h3>

      <p>
        This visualization shows the top ten categories of incidents where the most incidents were recorded in Demcember 2018. The color in this stacked chart shows the ratio of how many incidents are still active or cited.
      </p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        The goal of this visualization was to see the ratio of how many issues are resolved or still open depending on the category of the crime. Because the data had many subcategories, I took the top 10 categories with most incidents for December 2018 to show on this page.
